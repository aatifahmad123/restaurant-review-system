## Restaurant Review System

A web application to review and rate Indian dishes. Users can select dishes, provide ratings, and submit reviews. The reviews are passed through a machine learning model to identify sentiment - positive, neutral, or negative. Dish Name, Review and Sentiment Label are pushed to a Google Sheet which is further connected to Google Looker Studio for visualization.
